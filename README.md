Google Chrome Extension - Quick Writing Exercise

Quick Fiction
What is it?

Quick Fiction is a writing exercise inside Google Chrome Popup Extension. Quick Fiction randomly selects a character and a situation then provides the user 5 minutes and a text box. The goal is to write as much as you can within the 5 minute window. Once time is up Quick Fiction displays the user input as plain text within the popup. Users can copy and paste their story into their drive or a word document to work on later, or simply close out the popup.

Quick Fiction exists to provide a moment of creativity and designed to encourage stream of consciousness writing. You only have 5 minutes! Don't overthink it! Good luck and have fun.


The latest version.

Quick Fiction is in Beta. Currently, Quick Fiction only preforms the basic goal of random writing prompt and timer. Check out "Next Steps" for the future of Quick Fiction.
